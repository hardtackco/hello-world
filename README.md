## This is a template for how to structure a README ---

Synopsis
-----------
[At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains what the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)] 

This project is the introductory project to using GitHub. I do not know what it does yet, however I'm following along and trying to perform "perfect practice" so that as I learn to code, I don't fall into any bad habits.


Code Example
-----------
[Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.]

TBD

Motivation
-----------
[A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists.]

This project exists because I am trying to learn! This was the first tutorial provided.

Installation
-----------
[Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.]

TBD

API Reference
-----------
[Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.] 

No reference documents for this project, small enough in size that it doesn't need an API reference

Tests
-----------
[Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.]

Hasn't been included as there is no code yet. 

Contributors
-----------
[Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.]

Not applicable

License
-----------
[A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)]
